    <p>For me, testing and quality control is not something new, I
carried out the input control of raw materials and quality
control of finished products in the laboratory of paint and
varnish materials according to technical regulations and
DSTU, TU. In addition, I was able to significantly optimize
and accelerate the process of control and processing of
results through the introduction of computer technology
and establishing communication in intersectoral
production departments, which essential increased
productivity.
I'm hope my skills will find application in your development.
Thank you for your attention.</p>
